This project leverages the Python sentiment analysis library Pysentiment and extends its capabilities by incorporating additional sentiment categories, including "Uncertainty" and "Litigious". It also integrates the Loughran-McDonald Dictionary for more specialized financial and economic sentiment analysis. Additionally, the project includes a feature to count the total number of words in the analyzed text files, resulting in a more comprehensive and detailed sentiment analysis output.
